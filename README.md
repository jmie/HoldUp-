## What is it?

**HoldUp-** is a Chrome Extension for pausing YouTube videos, *opened in new browser tabs*.

The files for this extension are made available here, for further development and general use.

## Why?

I got fed up of videos playing over one another, when opening a bunch of related clips in new tabs.
